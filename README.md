## Lightweight Motion Detector for Constrained Devices
*This motion sensor project is designed to detect motion in real-time, capture
and summarise those frames, and trigger an alarm when an unknown person is
detected. The software system will continuously monitor the environment using a
Raspi camera, sounding an alarm and recording images (frames) whenever motion
is detected. Every video frame will be numbered and timestamped, allowing for
precise tracking of motion events. Additionally, security codes will be implemented
to enable or disable the alarm system, ensuring secure control of the systemâ€™s
operation.*
